Hands-on Lab: Installing and Updating Software

Overview
This lab covers how to find and install a new package onto a server, how to check that a package installed correctly, and how to add and delete packages from a server. For this lab, we will be extracting the packages Apache and Audacity, as well as deleting and then re-creating an EPEL package.
